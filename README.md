How to Install and Run the Website?
A 64-bit Windows Operating System will be ideal for this database management system. This system might still be able to run on MacOS or Linux but there is no guarantee it will be an exact recreation.
WampServer (64-bit) and phpmyadmin was also used to service our application.
Place all the files into the www folder that is in the wamp64 folder that should be in the C drive.
Once all the files placed in the www folder that is in the wamp64 folder, start your wampserver and make sure all the services are running. 
Import the SQL file into phpmyadmin. The database (db) should be named movie.
Afterwards, make sure the config.php code matches your host, user and password information in order for the connection to work. 
If everything succeeds, open the home page of Movieplex and browse through the website. If the database was connected successfully, it should display the movie info, theater info and tickets, as all this information is from the movie database.
